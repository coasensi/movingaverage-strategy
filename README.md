the moving average crossover strategy is a popular trading strategy used to identify potential buy and sell signals in financial markets.

2 key components: a short-term moving average (SMA) and a long-term moving average (LMA). the SMA captures recent price trends, while the LMA reflects longer-term trends.

##BUY signal:## when the SMA crosses above the LMA, the short-term price trend is gaining momentum and might continue to rise. this is interpreted as a bullish signal, suggesting it's a good time to buy the asset.

##SELL signal:## when the SMA crosses below the LMA,the short-term price trend is losing momentum and might continue to fall. this is interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting it's a good time to sell the asset.

You need to input your alpha vantage api key, as well as the backtest ticker and the periods for SMA and LMA.
